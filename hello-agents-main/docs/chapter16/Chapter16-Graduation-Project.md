# Chapter 16: Graduation Project - Building Your Own Multi-Agent Application

Congratulations on reaching the final chapter of the Hello-Agents tutorial! In the previous 15 chapters, we built the HelloAgents framework from scratch and learned about core agent concepts, multiple paradigms, tool systems, memory mechanisms, communication protocols, reinforcement learning training, and performance evaluation. In Chapters 13-15, we also demonstrated how to integrate all learned knowledge through three complete practical projects (Intelligent Travel Assistant, Automated Deep Research Agent, and Cyber Town).

Now, it's time for you to become a true agent system builder! This chapter will guide you in **building your own multi-agent application** and sharing your achievements with the community through open-source collaboration.

## 16.1 The Significance of the Graduation Project

### 16.1.1 Why Do a Graduation Project

The best way to learn technology is not by reading tutorials, but by **hands-on practice**. Through the previous chapters, you have mastered the theoretical knowledge and technical tools for building agent systems. However, the real challenge lies in: **How to apply this knowledge to real problems? How to design a complete system? How to handle various edge cases and exceptions?**

The core value of the graduation project is to cultivate your comprehensive application ability, selectively integrating all the knowledge learned previously (agent paradigms, tool systems, memory mechanisms, communication protocols, etc.) into a complete project.

Through the learning and practice in this chapter, we hope you can independently design and implement a complete agent application, skillfully use various functions of the HelloAgents framework, master basic Git and GitHub operations, learn to write clear project documentation, participate in open-source community collaborative development, and ultimately obtain a technical work you can showcase.

### 16.1.2 Form of the Graduation Project

Your graduation project will be submitted to the Hello-Agents co-creation project repository (`Co-creation-projects` directory) in the form of an **open-source project**. Specific requirements are as follows:

1. **Project Naming**: Use the format `{your-GitHub-username}-{project-name}`, for example `jjyaoao-CodeReviewAgent`

2. **Project Content**:
   - A runnable Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file) or Python script
   - Complete dependency list (`requirements.txt`)
   - Clear README documentation (`README.md`)
   - Optional: demo videos, screenshots, datasets, etc.

3. **Submission Method**: Submit via GitHub Pull Request (PR)

4. **Review Process**: Community members will review your code, provide improvement suggestions, and merge into the main repository after approval

## 16.2 Project Topic Selection Guide

### 16.2.1 Topic Selection Principles

A good graduation project should be practical, solving real problems rather than technology for technology's sake. We need to pursue completion within limited time and resources while clearly demonstrating your technical capabilities.

### 16.2.2 Recommended Topic Directions

Here are some recommended project directions - you can choose one or propose your own ideas:

**(1) Productivity Tools**

- **Intelligent Code Review Assistant**: Automatically analyze code quality, discover potential bugs, provide optimization suggestions
- **Intelligent Documentation Generator**: Automatically generate API documentation and user manuals based on code
- **Intelligent Meeting Assistant**: Record meeting content, generate meeting minutes, extract action items
- **Intelligent Email Assistant**: Automatically classify emails, generate reply drafts, remind of important matters

**(2) Learning Assistance**

- **Intelligent Learning Partner**: Recommend learning resources based on learning progress, generate practice questions, answer questions
- **Intelligent Paper Assistant**: Help find literature, summarize papers, generate citations
- **Intelligent Programming Tutor**: Provide programming exercises, code review, learning path planning
- **Intelligent Language Learning Assistant**: Provide conversation practice, grammar correction, vocabulary expansion

**(3) Creative Entertainment**

- **Intelligent Shopping Assistant**: Compare prices, recommend products, generate shopping lists
- **Intelligent Home Control**: Control smart home devices through natural language

### 16.2.3 Topic Selection Example

Let's illustrate how to select a topic and design a project through a specific example.

**Project Name**: Intelligent Code Review Assistant (CodeReviewAgent)

**Problem Analysis**: Code review is an important part of software development, but manual review is time-consuming and prone to missing issues. Existing static analysis tools can only find syntax errors and cannot understand code logic, so an intelligent assistant that can understand code semantics and provide in-depth analysis is needed.

**Core Functions**: This project will implement code quality analysis (check code style, naming conventions, comment completeness), potential bug detection (discover logic errors, boundary condition issues, resource leaks), performance optimization suggestions (identify performance bottlenecks, propose optimization solutions), security vulnerability scanning (detect SQL injection, XSS and other security issues), and best practice recommendations (propose improvements based on language features and design patterns).

**Expected Outcomes**: The final deliverable will be a runnable Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the complete review process, supporting mainstream languages like Python and JavaScript, capable of generating structured Markdown format review reports, and providing specific code examples and improvement suggestions.

### 16.4.5 Large File Handling Guide

**⚠️ Important: Avoid Oversized Main Repository**

To keep the Hello-Agents main repository lightweight, please follow these large file handling guidelines:

**(1) File Size Limits**

- **Total project size**: Not exceeding 5MB
- **Prohibited from direct submission**: Video files, large datasets, model files

**(2) Large File Handling Solutions**

If your project contains large files (datasets, videos, models, etc.), please use the following solutions:

**Solution 1: Use External Links (Recommended)**

Upload large files to external platforms and provide download links in README:

```markdown
## Datasets

The datasets used in this project are large. Please download from the following links:

- Dataset 1: [Baidu Netdisk](link) Extraction code: xxxx
- Dataset 2: [Google Drive](link)
- Demo video: [Bilibili](link) / [YouTube](link)
```

Recommended external platforms:
- **Datasets**: Baidu Netdisk, Google Drive, Kaggle, HuggingFace Datasets
- **Videos**: Bilibili, YouTube, Tencent Video
- **Models**: HuggingFace Models, ModelScope
- **Images**: GitHub Issues, image hosting services

**Solution 2: Create Independent Repository**

If the project has many resources, consider creating an independent data repository:

```markdown
## Project Resources

Due to the large amount of data and demo resources, a separate resource repository has been created:

- Resource repository: https://github.com/your-username/project-name-resources
- Contains: Datasets, demo videos, model files, test data, etc.

### Usage

\`\`\`bash
# Clone resource repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name-resources.git

# Copy data to project directory
cp -r project-name-resources/data ./data
\`\`\`
```

**Solution 3: Use Sample Data**

Only provide small-scale sample data in the main repository:

```python
# Explain in README
## Data Description

- `data/sample.csv`: Sample data (100 records)
- Complete dataset (100,000 records) download from [here](link)
```

**(3) Best Practice Example**

```
your-username-project-name/
├── README.md              # Contains external resource links
├── requirements.txt
├── main.ipynb
├── .gitignore            # Ignore large files
├── data/
│   └── sample.csv        # Sample data only (<1MB)
└── outputs/
    └── demo_result.png   # Demo results only (<1MB)
```

README explanation:

```markdown
## Data and Resources

### Sample Data

## 16.7 Summary and Outlook

By completing the graduation project, you should have mastered the complete process of agent system design: designing system architecture from requirements, skillfully using various functions and components of the HelloAgents framework, developing custom tools to extend agent capabilities, completing full project development from requirement analysis to code implementation, learning to use Git and GitHub for open-source collaboration, and writing clear technical documentation.

In this project, we built the HelloAgents framework from scratch and used it to implement multiple practical applications. Completing the graduation project is just the beginning. You can continue to deepen your learning of more agent paradigms and algorithms, prompt engineering and context engineering, multi-agent collaboration mechanisms, and other theoretical knowledge. You can also expand your technology stack by learning web development to build complete applications, learning databases to implement data persistence, and learning deployment to launch applications online. You can also continuously optimize your project by adding more features, optimizing performance and user experience, and improving testing and documentation. More importantly, actively participate in community contributions by helping other learners, participating in Hello-Agents framework development, and sharing your experiences and insights.

From the simple agent in Chapter 1 to now being able to independently build complete multi-agent applications, you have traveled through an exciting learning journey. But this is not the end - it's a new beginning.

AI technology is changing rapidly, and the agent field is full of infinite possibilities. We hope you can maintain curiosity and continuously learn new technologies, courageously use AI technology to solve practical problems and create value, willingly share your experiences and achievements with the community, and constantly refine your work in pursuit of excellence.

Finally, thank you for reading this project in its entirety. We hope you have gained something from the learning process and that you can apply what you've learned to actual projects, creating amazing agent applications. The future of AI is full of infinite possibilities - let's explore and create together!

**Remember: The best way to learn is through hands-on practice!**

Now, start building your own agent application! We look forward to seeing your excellent work in the Co-creation-projects directory!
